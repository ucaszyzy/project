2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1000 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.960 ns between design_1_i/YOLO2_FPGA_0/inst/beta_buffer_U/YOLO2_FPGA_beta_beTV_ram_U/ram_reg/CLKARDCLK (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/YOLO2_FPGA_0/inst/grp_intra_pingpong_wrapp_fu_1230/grp_compute4_fu_1110/grp_copy_local_beta_fu_2859/local_beta_buffer24_s_fu_250_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
